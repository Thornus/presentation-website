# Welcome to my presentation website repo
## What is this?
A one page website, which is a _fluid and intuitive_ way for presenting myself!

It's as simple as using the mouse wheel to navigate between sections.
## How is it done?
A simple `index.html` following the structure required by the jQuery scrolljacking plugin [Alton](https://github.com/paper-leaf/alton) and some CSS magic to make everything more appealing.
